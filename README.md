## [Fiscit Web UI Source](https://github.com/GalaxyVOID/FRM-s-WebUI-Source)

This is a beta version of the mod, which may have some bugs. If you find any issues, please contact me via my [**discord**](https://discordapp.com/users/56086820147953664).

Have you ever left your base to explore or work on another project and wondered if the power at home was still good? Do you want a small gadget or website that allows you to remotely monitor your power on your dedicated server? Fiscit Remote Monitoring is here for you!

**Note:** This mod is not required to be on everyone's mod list. You may run this mod alone or with your group.

## Third-party Support/Apps

Please note that I did not develop these tools, and thus cannot be of much assistance. I would advise contacting the developer/engineer of the tool if no solution can be found: All references here are by permission of the author.

## How to get started

1. Read the documentation on [https://docs.ficsit.app/ficsitremotemonitoring/latest/](https://docs.ficsit.app/ficsitremotemonitoring/latest/).
2. The web server may be started/stopped by using `/frmweb {start/stop}` in the chat window.
3. The serial communication may be started/stopped by using `/frmserial {start/stop}` in the chat window.
4. For Serial, specify the Serial port associated (Windows Device Manager helps with this), then set the Baud Rate.
   - Due to the library used, only the baud rate can be changed; you must use 8-N-1 (8 bits, No parity, 1 stop bit).

## Features

- Power Monitoring on a selected circuit.
- Battery status, charge, capacity, time until out of power.
- Output Serial Devices like RaspberryPi, Arduino, and other RS-232 devices.
- Input support to remotely reset fuses or issue other commands.
- JSON Support for output to allow updates and additional input/output without disrupting current setups.
- Web Server Support, complete with Power Information as well as Real-Time Tracking of Player (not multiplayer tested, but should work).

## WIP / Future Features

- Input functionality, i.e., turn on/off switches.

## Known Bugs

See [Remote Monitoring Github Issues](https://github.com/porisius/FicsitRemoteMonitoring/issues).

## Feedback

If you have any options or features that you want, @ me in the modding Discord.

## Permissions granted

You are permitted to create your own UIs for either Web and/or Serial and display them where appropriate (i.e., Discord, Reddit, etc).

Please keep it in accordance with the social media rules and ToS.
