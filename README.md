### **Known Bugs**

- For a list of known issues, please visit our [Remote Monitoring Github Issues](https://github.com/porisius/FicsitRemoteMonitoring/issues).
- Icon system does not work on dedicated servers. Please upload the Icons folder after running your game locally (with Remote Monitoring installed) to your dedicated server's Icons folder. This is not a fault of the mod or even the game. This is due to Unreal Engine assets are not present in server (Windows and Linux) builds.
