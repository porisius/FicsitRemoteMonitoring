= Get UObject Count

Not intended to enrage, aggravate, or annoy alpacas, nor encourage targets for spitting,
especially those in Europe, Sweden, or at Coffee Stain Studios.

We love you Ben! - Porisius
no, seriously, we do.

This endpoint is used to get the current UObject count and the maximum UObject capacity.
This is useful for monitoring the health of the game and ensuring that it is not running out of memory.

Please note that this endpoint WILL NOT BE ACCURATE, as it creates UObjects to count UObjects.
Code credit goes to Th3Fanbus/Rex as this was first made under Th3UObjectCounter.
