| CircuitGroupID | Integer | ID of the circuit.
| PowerProduction | Float | Power production of the circuit.
| PowerConsumed | Float | Power consumed on power circuit.
| PowerCapacity | Float | Power capacity on power circuit.
| PowerMaxConsumed | Float | Maximum Power that can be consumed on power circuit.
| BatteryInput | Float | The combined power input to all the batteries connected to this circuit. Negative values denote power output.
| BatteryOutput | Float | The combined power output from all the batteries connected to this circuit.
| BatteryDifferential | Float | Amount of power in excess/deficit going into or out of the batteries. Positive = Charges batteries, Negative = Drains batteries
| BatteryPercent | Float | Percentage of batteries.
| BatteryCapacity | Float | Total capacity of batteries.
| BatteryTimeEmpty | String | Time until Batteries are empty. Format: Hours:Minutes:Seconds
| BatteryTimeFull | String | Time until Batteries are full. Format: Hours:Minutes:Seconds
| AssociatedCircuits | Integer[] | All the circuit IDs that this group owns.
| FuseTriggered | Boolean | Has the fuse been triggered?
