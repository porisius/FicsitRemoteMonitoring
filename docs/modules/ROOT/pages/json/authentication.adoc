= Authentication

An authentication token is automatically generated when the mod is loaded.

The token can be found in the `Configs/FicsitRemoteMonitoring/WebServer.cfg` file under the `Authentication_Token` key. You can also set your own token in the file. +
If left empty, a new token will be generated.

== Passing the token to the API

Use it to set an API request’s Authorization header.
`Authorization: <token goes here>`
